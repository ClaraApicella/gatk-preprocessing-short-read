#Configuration file for 0_gatk_preprocessing_main.sh
#This is the main script for the pre-processing of short-reads sequencing data
#Following the guidelines https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360039568932

#All scripts and configuration files are in the same directory

#Configuration parameters:
#{project_root}: the directory where all the data and results files are stored for a given sequencing run
#This directory needs to contain a 'raw_data' folder with raw fastq.gz files.
project_root='/scratch/tmp/apicella/projects/wormsQC/dmx/Runs_109_cycles'
#{picard}: the path to the picard.jar file
picard='/scratch/tmp/apicella/software/picard/picard_3.0.0/picard.jar'

#{REF}:Reference files directory and ref prefix
#{REF}=Path to the genome reference files directory and ref prefix.
    #This folder needs to contain bwa index files with the same prefix of the .fa file.
    #The index files can be generated with: bwa index -p {chosen_prefix} -a bwtsw {genome.fasta}
    #With the same prefix a .fa.fai and .dict files need to be present (this can be generated with respectively)
REF='/scratch/tmp/apicella/references/bwa/hg38_ens110'
